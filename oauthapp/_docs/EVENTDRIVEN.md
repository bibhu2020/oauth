## Azure Event Grid
Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocols.

Event Grid can be configured to send events to subscribers (push delivery) or subscribers can connect to Event Grid to read events (pull delivery). Event Grid supports CloudEvents 1.0 specification to provide interoperability across systems.

Event Grid conforms to Cloud Native Computing Foundationâ€™s open standard CloudEvents 1.0 specification using the HTTP protocol binding with JSON format. Event message look like below.
