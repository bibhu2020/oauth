# Understanding Application Authentication and Authorization

In the world of application security, authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts that play crucial roles in ensuring secure access to resources. Here's a detailed look at what each of these terms entails, the various options available, and how Single Sign-On (SSO) connects to them.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of validating user credentials (such as a user ID and password) to ensure that the person attempting to gain access is indeed who they claim to be. There are several types of authentication methods based on how credentials are transferred:

### Types of Authentication

1. **HTML Forms**
   - The user ID and password are sent via the HTTP POST method over SSL/TLS.
   
2. **HTTP Basic**
   - The browser prompts the user to log in with credentials, which are then sent base-64 encrypted over SSL/TLS.
   
3. **Digest-Based**
   - Similar to HTTP Basic, but uses hashed passwords instead of base-64 encrypted ones.
   
4. **Certificate-Based**
   - Utilizes private-public key-based certificates for authentication.

### Managing Authentication State

Authentication can be managed in two primary ways based on how subsequent server calls are handled:

1. **Stateful Authentication**
   - Uses server sessions to maintain the authentication state, sending a session ID to the user for subsequent calls.
   - Scalability can be an issue since the session store is specific to each server, requiring a session cache server for scalable solutions.
   - Revoking access is straightforward by removing the session from the store.
     - Attacker with session id, can impersonate the user.
     - Attacker can inject malicious scripts to steal session cookies.

2. **Stateless Authentication**
   - Uses signed or encrypted tokens containing user details (e.g., ID, name, role) signed with a private key.
   - Tokens are stored in the user's browser cookies, decentralizing authentication.
   - Tokens are validated by decrypting them with a public key on subsequent calls.
   - Revoking access is more complex due to decentralization, but can be managed by setting short expiry times for tokens or using a token server for revocation.
   - If token falls into wrong hand, it could be exploited. You can protect it by doing the followings
      - Short token expiry time
      - A mechanism to revoke token
      - Verify signature in token
      - Secure communication with HTTPS
      - Limit the permission & scope to the token
      - Validate audience ('aud') and issuer ('iss')

## Authorization

Authorization determines what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform. It typically follows successful authentication. There are various mechanisms for authorization, each with its own use cases and characteristics:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization.
   
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Grants access based on attributes (e.g., user attributes, resource attributes, environment conditions).
   
3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
   - Lists specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects and what operations are allowed on given objects.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a significant concept that bridges both authentication and authorization. It allows a user to log in to multiple applications using a single set of credentials, simplifying the user experience and enhancing efficiency. SSO systems often integrate with identity providers like Google or Facebook and employ various protocols to manage authentication and authorization seamlessly.

### Connecting SSO to Authentication and Authorization

SSO leverages both authentication and authorization to provide seamless and secure access to multiple applications. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Authentication in SSO**
   - When a user logs in through an SSO provider, they are authenticated once. This single authentication session is then recognized across multiple applications.
   
2. **Authorization in SSO**
   - After authentication, the SSO provider also conveys the user's authorization information to different applications. This information includes what resources the user can access and what actions they can perform.
   - SSO systems ensure that applications trust the identity provider's authorization decisions, thus eliminating the need for multiple authorization checks.

### SSO Protocols

1. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**
   - An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers (IdPs) and service providers.
   - Utilizes XML documents called assertions that contain user authorization information.
   - SAML is used for both authentication and authorization, enabling SSO by verifying user identity and permissions, then granting or denying access to services.

2. **OAuth2**
   - Developed to address SAML's limitations on mobile platforms and based on JSON rather than XML.
   - Widely uses JWT tokens for lightweight and fast authorization.
   - Commonly used for client-to-server authorization but can also facilitate SSO by allowing users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing credentials.

3. **API Key**
   - Used primarily for server-to-server authorization.
   - Provides access to APIs, identifying the origin of the request (valid for specific domains or IP addresses).

4. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
   - An identity layer on top of OAuth2, used for authentication.
   - Enables SSO by allowing one login session to be used across multiple applications.
   - Provides additional information about the user to enhance the authorization process.

## Conclusion

Understanding the connection between authentication, authorization, and Single Sign-On (SSO) is essential for building secure and user-friendly applications. Authentication verifies user identity, authorization determines access levels, and SSO combines these processes to provide seamless access across multiple applications. By implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms and leveraging SSO protocols, developers can ensure that users enjoy a secure and efficient experience.
