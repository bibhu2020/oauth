# OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow vs. PKCE Flow

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow is commonly used by confidential clients, such as server-side web applications. It is designed to securely exchange an authorization code for an access token. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to the authorization server, where the user authenticates and authorizes the application.

2. **Authorization Code**: The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code after the user grants access.

3. **Token Exchange**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a request to the authorization server, including the client secret for authentication.

## PKCE Flow (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow, designed to enhance security, particularly for public clients that cannot securely store a client secret, such as mobile apps and single-page applications (SPAs). The PKCE flow adds additional steps to protect the exchange of the authorization code:

1. **Generate a Code Verifier**: The client generates a random string called a code verifier before making the authorization request.

2. **Create a Code Challenge**: The client creates a code challenge by hashing the code verifier (typically using SHA-256) and base64url-encoding it.

3. **Authorization Request**: The client includes the code challenge in the authorization request to the authorization server.

4. **Authorization Code**: The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code, after storing the code challenge.

5. **Token Exchange**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by sending the code verifier to the authorization server. The server verifies the code challenge and code verifier before issuing the access token.

## Key Differences

### Client Secret

- **Standard OAuth Code Flow**: Requires a client secret for exchanging the authorization code.
- **PKCE Flow**: Does not require a client secret; uses a code verifier and code challenge instead.

### Security

- **Standard OAuth Code Flow**: Relies on the security of the client secret, making it vulnerable if the authorization code is intercepted.
- **PKCE Flow**: Adds security by ensuring that the authorization code cannot be used by unauthorized parties, even if intercepted.

### Use Cases

- **Standard OAuth Code Flow**: Best suited for server-side applications where the client secret can be securely stored.
- **PKCE Flow**: Ideal for public clients (e.g., mobile apps, SPAs) that cannot securely store a client secret.

## Summary

The PKCE flow is an enhancement of the standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow that provides additional security by preventing the misuse of the authorization code if intercepted. This makes it particularly suitable for public clients that cannot securely store client secrets.
