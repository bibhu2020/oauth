Large-scale applications use stateless authorization like OAuth2. OAuth2 has been designed for distributed systems where there is a clear separation between resource server and authorization server. They can potentially be in different domains as well. Hence, it is immensely popular. 

Think of a scenario where you have a web application that wants to access the Google contacts. The user must delegate grant to the SERVER to access the Google Contacts. 

1. The application (**CLIENT**) presents the user (**RESOURCE OWNER**) with a form with a button asking to authorize the Web Server (**SERVER**) to access the Google Contacts (**RESOURCE SERVER**).

2. When the user clicks the button, the user is redirected to Google "**AUTHORIZATION SERVER**" with a list of parameters:
  - request scope: contacts (what resource and access you are asking for)
  - response type: code (authorization code, not token) - also called grant
  - callback URL: It's the URL to which the AUTHORIZATION SERVER will redirect the user to after authorizing. 
  - client Id (It's a unique id assigned to your application by the AUTHORIZATION SERVER)

3. When the Authorization server receives the request, it redirects the user to login (if not logged in already). After successful login, it takes the user to a screen asking for permission on the scope.

4. When the user allows the permission, the "AUTHORIZATION SERVER" will redirect to the "callback URL." on AGENT / Browser and send a temporary grant (also called authorization code).

5. AGENT / Browser shares the Authorization code with the SERVR / Web Server.

6. SERVER sends the Authorization Code to "AUTHORIZATION SERVER". 

7. The "AUTHORIZATION SERVER" validates the code and sends an Access Token to the SERVER.

8. SERVER uses the "Access Token" to access the RESOURCE SERVER (Google Contacts).

9. RESOURCE SERVER sends the resource (contacts) to the SERVER.

## OAuth 2.0 Terminology

- **Resource Owner**: Entity that can grant access to a protected resource. Typically, this is the end-user.

- **User Agent**: Agent used by the Resource Owner to interact with the Client (for example, a browser or a native application).

- **Client / Web Server**: Application requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the Resource Owner.

- **IDP App / App Registration**: Is the App on the Authorization Server that acts like a proxy between Client and Authorization Server. (not shown in the picture)

- **Authorization Server**: Server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues Access Tokens after getting proper authorization. In this case, Auth0.

- **Resource Server**: Server hosting the protected resources. This is the API you want to access.
