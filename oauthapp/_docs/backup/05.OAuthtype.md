# OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flows

OAuth 2.0 defines several authorization grant types, each designed for different use cases and scenarios. Here are the primary types of OAuth 2.0 flows:

- Authorization Code Grant (Client/Browser redirects the user to IDP endpoint to collect the user credential)
- Implicit Grant (It's same as Authorization Code Grant. But It's used on SPA where code is executing on the client browser)
- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Client/Browser collects the user credential instead of IDP endpoint.)
- Client Credentials Grant (used for server to server interaction using client secret.)
- Device Code Grant
- JWT Bearer Token Grant
- Refresh Token Grant 

## 1. Authorization Code Grant

**Use Case**: Used by web and mobile applications to obtain an access token.

**Flow**:
1. The client redirects the user to the authorization server's authorization endpoint.
2. The user authenticates and grants permission to the client.
3. The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
4. The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a request to the token endpoint.
5. The authorization server returns an access token to the client.

**Security**: This flow is considered secure as the client secret is not exposed and the authorization code is short-lived.

## 2. Implicit Grant

**Use Case**: Suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) or applications running in the browser.

**Flow**:
1. The client redirects the user to the authorization server's authorization endpoint.
2. The user authenticates and grants permission to the client.
3. The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an access token in the URL fragment.
4. The client extracts the access token from the URL.

**Security**: Less secure than the authorization code grant as the access token is exposed in the URL and can be accessed by malicious scripts.

## 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

**Use Case**: Suitable for highly trusted applications where the user directly provides their username and password to the client.

**Flow**:
1. The client collects the user's username and password.
2. The client sends the username and password to the authorization server's token endpoint.
3. The authorization server validates the credentials and returns an access token.

**Security**: Should be avoided if possible due to security concerns; the client must handle and protect the user's credentials.

## 4. Client Credentials Grant

**Use Case**: Used for server-to-server interactions where no user is involved.

**Flow**:
1. The client sends a request to the token endpoint with its client ID and client secret.
2. The authorization server validates the credentials and returns an access token.

**Security**: Suitable for backend services; the client secret must be securely stored.

## 5. Device Code Grant

**Use Case**: Used for devices with limited input capabilities, like smart TVs or IoT devices.

**Flow**:
1. The client requests a device code and user code from the authorization server.
2. The user is instructed to visit a URL and enter the user code to authenticate.
3. The device polls the authorization server for the access token.
4. Once the user authenticates, the authorization server returns an access token to the device.

**Security**: User-friendly for devices with limited input capabilities; polling for tokens should be done securely.

## 6. JWT Bearer Token Grant

**Use Case**: Used to exchange a JWT (JSON Web Token) for an OAuth 2.0 access token.

**Flow**:
1. The client sends a request to the token endpoint with a signed JWT.
2. The authorization server validates the JWT and returns an access token.

**Security**: Allows for SSO (Single Sign-On) scenarios; the JWT must be signed and securely generated.

## Additional Flow

### Refresh Token Grant

**Use Case**: Used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token.

**Flow**:
1. The client sends a request to the token endpoint with the refresh token.
2. The authorization server validates the refresh token and returns a new access token.

**Security**: Helps maintain long-lived sessions without requiring the user to re-authenticate frequently.

## Choosing the Right Flow

- **Web Apps**: Typically use the Authorization Code Grant.
- **Single-Page Apps**: Might use the Implicit Grant, though Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is recommended for better security.
- **Server-to-Server**: Use the Client Credentials Grant.
- **Trusted Applications**: Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant, though this should be avoided when possible.
- **Devices with Limited Input**: Device Code Grant.

Each flow is designed to address different security and usability requirements, making OAuth 2.0 a flexible and powerful protocol for a wide range of applications.
