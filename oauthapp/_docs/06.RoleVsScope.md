# Azure AD App Registration: Roles vs. Scopes

In Azure AD, "roles" and "scopes" are both used to control access to resources, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

## Roles

Roles are used to define what an application or user can do within an application. They are often associated with permissions within the application itself.

- **Application Roles**: These are used within your application to assign specific permissions or roles to users. For example, you might have roles like "admin," "user," or "viewer."
  - **Admin Consent**: Application roles typically require admin consent. This means an Azure AD admin must grant permission for the application to assign these roles to users.
  - **Assignment**: Roles are assigned to users or groups directly within the Azure AD App Registration or Enterprise Application settings.
  - **Claims**: When a user authenticates, their roles are included in the token as claims.

## Scopes

Scopes, also known as delegated permissions, define what an application can do on behalf of a user. Scopes are often used in the context of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to specify the level of access requested by an application.

- **API Scopes**: When an application needs to access another application's API or a Microsoft API (like Microsoft Graph), it requests specific scopes. For example, `User.Read` or `Mail.Send`.
  - **User Consent**: Scopes usually require user consent. The user grants the application permission to perform certain actions on their behalf.
  - **Granularity**: Scopes can be fine-grained, allowing you to request only the permissions you need. This follows the principle of least privilege.
  - **Authorization**: Scopes are used in the authorization process. When a user logs in, they see a consent screen where they can grant or deny the requested scopes.

## Key Differences

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Roles**: Define what a user or service can do within the application.
   - **Scopes**: Define what an application can do on behalf of a user, typically when accessing APIs.

2. **Consent**:
   - **Roles**: Usually require admin consent.
   - **Scopes**: Usually require user consent, though some scopes can also require admin consent.

3. **Assignment**:
   - **Roles**: Assigned directly to users or groups in Azure AD.
   - **Scopes**: Requested dynamically by applications during the authentication process.

4. **Claims**:
   - **Roles**: Included in tokens as role claims.
   - **Scopes**: Included in tokens as scope claims.

## Example Use Case

- **Roles**: You have an internal business application where you define roles like "manager" and "employee." A manager can approve expenses, while an employee can only submit expenses.
- **Scopes**: You have a web application that needs to read the user's emails from Microsoft Graph. You would request the `Mail.Read` scope during the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between roles and scopes is crucial for designing secure and efficient access control in your applications. Roles are best suited for defining permissions within your application, while scopes are ideal for managing access to external APIs and services.
